# Swarm Robotics and Formation Control

## ABSTRACT
Swarm robotics is an approach to the coordination of multirobot systems which consist of large numbers of mostly simple physical robots. In this project we will focus our work on understanding and implementing the formation control of swarm robots.

## GOALS
1. Develop localisation method for swarm
2. Implement various motion planning algorithms for single robot
3. Implement various motion planning algorithms for swarm robots
4. Explore dynamic planning for active swarm

# Lab Automation System

## ABSTRACT
Laboratory autonomation is aimed at improving the efficiency of the lab and everyone working within the lab. In this project we will be building a complete autonomation system which will have intelligent lighting system, person detection and tracking, implementing user defined preferences, etc.

## GOALS
1. Control all the electronics in the lab online
2. Count number of  people in the lab and switch on or off electronics based on that
3. Track people and switch on electronics only in their vicinity
4. Recognise people
5. Implement various user defined preferences like temperature control, lighting control, etc.

# Automated Stock Management System

## ABSTRACT
Managing stock in any lab is a task which requires a lot of manual work. This project is aimed to automate some of the manual tasks, which includes inventory management, and stock issuance.

## GOALS
1. Issue Stock to students based on Object Detection
2. Train a Deep Learning (DL) Model to specifically trained to classify Lab stock items
3. Design and implement an IOT system for inventory management to associate with this DL Model
4. Create a technical database designed to facilitate automation system

# Person Tracking and Following Robot

## ABSTRACT
Object detection and tracking is a widely researched field. In this project we will be building 2 robots; one which is stationary and uses a manipulator to track a person or object; second, which is  a mobile robot capable of following the person around a room. The application for this project can be many but our design will be targeted towards bloggers, youtubers, speakers, etc. who want to record themselves with ease.

## GOALS
1. Implement Face detection
2. Implement Face tracking
3. Implement Face recognition
4. Design both robots
5. Test and improve real time applicability
6. Interface with multiple devices

# Pick and Place using Kinect and Robotic Arm

## ABSTRACT
Robotic pick and place automation speeds up the process of picking parts up and placing them in new locations, increasing production rates. In this project we will be developing a robotic arm in simulation and in real, able to pick and place an object while using the information from a kinect 3D camera.

## GOALS
1. Understand theoretical model of a manipulator
2. Calculate kinematics and dynamics of an actual robotic arm
3. Implement object segmentation using kinect
4. Implement transforms for the arm and objects.
5. Implement motion planning for the manipulator
6. Test and improve the pick and place mechanism
