# 1. Swarm Robotics and Formation Control

### Mentors :- Akanshu Mahajan, Ridhwan Luthra, Vaibhav Jain

### Students :- Harry Karwasra, Pranav Kumar, Thomas Kuruvila

## ABSTRACT
Swarm robotics is an approach to the coordination of multirobot systems which consist of large numbers of mostly simple physical robots. In this project we will focus our work on understanding and implementing the formation control of swarm robots.

## GOALS
1. Develop localisation method for swarm
2. Implement various motion planning algorithms for single robot
3. Implement various motion planning algorithms for swarm robots
4. Explore dynamic planning for active swarm

# 2. Lab Automation System

### Mentors :- Peeyush Aggarwal, Vikas Kamboj, Shreyas Sachan

### Students :- Akanksha, Mohd Abis, Bharat Sardana

## ABSTRACT
Laboratory autonomation is aimed at improving the efficiency of the lab and everyone working within the lab. In this project we will be building a complete autonomation system which will have intelligent lighting system, person detection and tracking, implementing user defined preferences, etc.

## GOALS
1. Control all the electronics in the lab online
2. Count number of  people in the lab and switch on or off electronics based on that
3. Track people and switch on electronics only in their vicinity
4. Recognise people
5. Implement various user defined preferences like temperature control, lighting control, etc.

# 3. Person Tracking and Following Robot

### Mentors :- Rishab Grover, Ashish Sethi, Ridhwan Luthra

### Students :- Parth Joshi, Prakhar Gupta, Ashish Priyadarshi

## ABSTRACT
Object detection and tracking is a widely researched field. In this project we will be building 2 robots; one which is stationary and uses a manipulator to track a person or object; second, which is  a mobile robot capable of following the person around a room. The application for this project can be many but our design will be targeted towards bloggers, youtubers, speakers, etc. who want to record themselves with ease.

## GOALS
1. Implement Face detection
2. Implement Face tracking
3. Implement Face recognition
4. Design both robots
5. Test and improve real time applicability
6. Interface with multiple devices
