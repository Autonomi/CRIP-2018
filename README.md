## About CRIP
**CIC Robotics Internship Programme (CRIP)** is summer internship programme for students interested in gaining experience in Robotics. This programme is organised by Autonomi, the Robotics Society of the *Cluster Innovation Centre (CIC), University of Delhi* to give students the opportunity to spend the break between their semesters working on projects related to their interests.
