# 1. Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM)

## ABSTRACT
In robotic mapping and navigation, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it. In this project we aim to break down this field into small chunks and prepare each module separately to finally build a unified SLAM robot.

## GOALS
1. Implement various motion planning algorithms
2. Implement various localisation algorithms
3. Explore Visual SLAM
4. Combine localisation and motion planning algorithms to navigate a predefined area while reducing errors
5. Explore various mapping techniques using various sensors
6. Integrate everything and build a SLAM robot

# 2. Swarm Robotics and Formation Control

## ABSTRACT
Swarm robotics is an approach to the coordination of multirobot systems which consist of large numbers of mostly simple physical robots. In this project we will focus our work on understanding and implementing the formation control of swarm robots.

## GOALS
1. Develop localisation method for swarm
2. Implement various motion planning algorithms for single robot
3. Implement various motion planning algorithms for swarm robots
4. Explore dynamic planning for active swarm

# 3. Lab Automation System

## ABSTRACT
Laboratory autonomation is aimed at improving the efficiency of the lab and everyone working within the lab. In this project we will be building a complete autonomation system which will have intelligent lighting system, person detection and tracking, implementing user defined preferences, etc.

## GOALS
1. Control all the electronics in the lab online
2. Count number of  people in the lab and switch on or off electronics based on that
3. Track people and switch on electronics only in their vicinity
4. Recognise people
5. Implement various user defined preferences like temperature control, lighting control, etc.

# 4. Person Tracking and Following Robot

## ABSTRACT
Object detection and tracking is a widely researched field. In this project we will be building 2 robots; one which is stationary and uses a manipulator to track a person or object; second, which is  a mobile robot capable of following the person around a room. The application for this project can be many but our design will be targeted towards bloggers, youtubers, speakers, etc. who want to record themselves with ease.

## GOALS
1. Implement Face detection
2. Implement Face tracking
3. Implement Face recognition
4. Design both robots
5. Test and improve real time applicability
6. Interface with multiple devices

# 5. Pick and Place using Kinect and Robotic Arm

## ABSTRACT
Robotic pick and place automation speeds up the process of picking parts up and placing them in new locations, increasing production rates. In this project we will be developing a robotic arm in simulation and in real, able to pick and place an object while using the information from a kinect 3D camera.

## GOALS
1. Understand theoretical model of a manipulator
2. Calculate kinematics and dynamics of an actual robotic arm
3. Implement object segmentation using kinect
4. Implement transforms for the arm and objects.
5. Implement motion planning for the manipulator
6. Test and improve the pick and place mechanism

# 6. Waiter Robots

## Abstract
Robots that follow the line and deliver food items and other stuff from one place to another. They must know each others’ location so that they don’t collide with each other.

## Goals
1. The bots must be stable enough and can handle stuff
2. Follow the line properly
3. Communication between the robots must be good
4. Self Charge (go to power socket and charge itself)
5. Robot must be User Friendly
6. Design must be cool
